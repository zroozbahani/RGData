The processed data includes ten learning features (independent variables) and one target feature (dependent variable). We call this dataset as Feature Table of ResearchGate (FTRG). In our data set, there are 13 columns in which the columns stand for first user id, second user id, following, followers, question-answers, country, city, H_index, RG rank, department, research similarity, skill similarity, and previous collaboration, respectively. The features’ value is calculated based on the first and second researchers’ raw data. Putting these two columns aside, there remain ten features that help the predictors to provide their results.

In this folder, we have three tables of pair-wise comparison and another feature similarity table. The feature similarity table contains 16 million pair-wise comparisons, and the co-author recommender system file is the data that has been used for evaluation of recommendation quality. A full description of this data set can be found in Table 12 of our paper Presenting a Dataset for Collaborator Recommending Systems in Academic Social Network: a Case Study on ReseachGate.
